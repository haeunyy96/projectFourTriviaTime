// PSUEDO CODE //

// Allow for users to select the amount of players from a drop down sectioon
// Once number of players are selected mount the UserChoice component, so use the selection for the length of an array and map through to generate the player name & input section
// User selects category of questions -> once submitted player names get added to firebase along with the avatar -> category selected gets used within the TriviaApi
// Reroute to Questions.js with the generated info from TriviaApi -> map through state and add questions to component -  setTimeout() function helps with keeping track of the time - if user hits submit button or they dont answer the question in time they're pushed to the next question. 
// Store score in firebase related to the player playing
// When all players have finished playing their games the winner is then present in Leaderboard.js with their name and avatar!!!! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
// If user chooses to restart game user info is deleted from firebase and rerouted to Form.js to play again.
