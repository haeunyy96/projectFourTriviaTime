Hi there 👋🏽

Welcome to our Project Repo!

This app was worked on & maintained by Haeun, James, Grace & Nin. 

This app is a game that allows users to play against each other or by themself and test their knowledge on random facts! 

How to play:
1. Choose the number of players 👥 and add your names!
2. Choose a quiz category, number of questions and the level of difficulty 😬
3. The timer will run for 15, 30 or 60 seconds based on the chosen level of difficulty
4. At the end of the game, the 🏆 WINNER 🏆 will be announced!

Sounds exciting?! Click this link to try it out now! ✨ https://thetriviatime.netlify.app/ ✨
