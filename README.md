Hi there 👋🏽

Welcome to our Project Repo!

This app was worked on & maintained by Haeun, James, Grace & Nin. 

This app is a game that allows users to play against each other or by themself and test their knowledge on random facts! 

How to play:
1. Choose the number of players 👥 and add your names!
2. Choose a quiz category and select the level of difficulty 😬
3. Each person will get 3 questions based on the chosen category
4. The timer will run for 15, 30 or 60 seconds based on the chosen level of difficulty
5. At the end of the game, the 🏆 WINNER 🏆 will be announced!

Sounds exciting?! Click this link to try it out now! ✨ https://thetriviatime.netlify.app/ ✨
